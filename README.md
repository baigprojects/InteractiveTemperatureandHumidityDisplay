# Interactive Temperature and Humidity Display
This Arduino project uses a DHT11 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity, providing real-time data on an LCD display. The system is programmed to trigger LED indicators and buzzers at various temperature thresholds: a blue LED for temperatures below 25°C, a green LED for 25°C to 30°C, a yellow LED for 30°C to 35°C with an active buzzer, and a red LED above 35°C with both active and passive buzzers. This project demonstrates practical applications of sensor integration and real-time monitoring with Arduino.
# What I learned
- How to integrate sensors and actuators into an Arduino system for real-time environmental monitoring.
- Techniques for using conditional logic to control multiple outputs (LEDs and buzzers) based on sensor data.
- The importance of optimizing code for efficient sensor reading and user feedback through visual and auditory signals.
